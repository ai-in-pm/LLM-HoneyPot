# LLM Honeypot System with Advanced AI Agents

A sophisticated cybersecurity system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Honeypot systems, managed by a team of specialized AI agents. This project combines cutting-edge AI technology with advanced cybersecurity practices to create an intelligent threat detection and analysis system.

## 🤖 AI Agent Team

Our system is powered by six specialized AI agents, each with unique expertise:

1. **Lead Architect (Dr. Sarah Chen)**
   - System Architecture and LLM Integration
   - Overall project leadership
   - Architecture design and system integration

2. **LLM Specialist (Dr. James Rodriguez)**
   - Large Language Model implementation
   - Model fine-tuning and optimization
   - Response generation systems

3. **Honeypot Expert (Dr. Aisha Patel)**
   - Advanced Honeypot system configuration
   - Threat detection setup
   - Attack surface design

4. **Security Analyst (Dr. Marcus Weber)**
   - Threat analysis and pattern recognition
   - Security testing and assessment
   - Vulnerability detection

5. **Infrastructure Engineer (Dr. Elena Popov)**
   - Cloud infrastructure management
   - System deployment
   - Scaling and performance optimization

6. **Data Scientist (Dr. Kai Yamamoto)**
   - ML Operations
   - Data analysis and processing
   - Model performance optimization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment
- Required API keys (see Configuration section)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd llm-honeypot
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment variables:
Create a `.env` file with the following API keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
COHERE_API_KEY=your_key_here
EMERGENCEAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
python main.py
```

The API server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. 

6. Start the Streamlit UI (in a new terminal):
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The Streamlit UI will automatically open in your default browser, typically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🖥️ User Interface

The Streamlit UI provides three main sections:

1. **Agent Interaction**
   - Select an AI agent to interact with
   - Submit tasks and view responses
   - Real-time processing feedback

2. **Threat Analysis**
   - Submit potential threats for analysis
   - View comprehensive threat assessments
   - Get real-time security recommendations

3. **System Metrics**
   - Monitor active threats
   - Track system performance
   - View threat detection timeline
